This repository contains an implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Iris Flowere Dataset available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris

The implementation does not use packages or libraries that provide the principal components in a single line of code. 
It is important to understand the data and select the principal components based on their variances and hence this implementation provides an insight into the data and let's the user make the decisions.
